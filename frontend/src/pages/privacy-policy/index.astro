        This policy applies to our handling of information about site visitors
        and users. We refer collectively to these categories of individuals as
        “you” throughout this policy.

      <h2>What we collect and why</h2>
      <p>
        Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that
        means in practice:
      </p>
      <ol class="left-margin">
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Identity and access</strong> &mdash; When you sign up for {
              Var.app.name
            }, we only collect your username and password.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not ask for any identifying information such as your name,
            email address, country of residence and maybe a company name.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Donation information</strong> &mdash; If you donate to {
              Var.app.name
            }, you will be asked to provide your payment information and email.
          </p>
          <p>
            The payment information is submitted directly to our payment
            processor and doesn’t hit our servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our payment process allows us to explore the list of donors but we
            cannot link a donor to any account on {Var.app.name}.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Product interactions</strong> &mdash; We store your journal entries
            on our servers. This is so you can use {Var.app.name} as intended.
          </p>
          <p>We keep this content as long as your account is active.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>General Geolocation and IP data</strong> &mdash; We do not log/save
            your geolocation or IP address.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Website interactions</strong> &mdash; We do not collect information
            about your browsing or journaling activity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Cookies</strong> &mdash; We use two persistent first-party cookies
            for user authentication. They are: <u>isLogged</u> and <u
              >sessionId</u
            > (HttpOnly & Secure)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Voluntary correspondence</strong> &mdash; When you email {
              Var.app.name
            } with a question or to ask for help, we maintain a history of that correspondence
            to refer if you reach out in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also store information you may volunteer, for example, written
            responses to surveys.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you agree to a customer interview, we may ask for your permission
            to record the conversation for future reference or use.
          </p>
          <p>We will only do so with your express consent.</p>

            Our employees looks at your content except for limited purposes with
            your express permission, for example, if an error occurs that stops
            an automated process from working and requires manual intervention
            to fix. These are rare cases, and when they happen, we look for root
            cause solutions as much as possible to avoid them recurring. We may
            also access your data if required in order to respond to legal
            process (see “When required under applicable law” below).

        </li>
        <li>

            <strong>To exclude you from seeing our ads</strong> &mdash; Where permissible
            by law and if you have a {Var.app.name} account, we may disclose a one-way
            hash of your email address with ad companies to exclude you from seeing
            our ads.

              </Link></strong
            > &mdash; Accessing a customer’s account when investigating potential
            abuse is a measure of last resort. We want to protect the privacy and
            safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us, and
            we do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process.
            If we discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we
            will take action as necessary, including notifying appropriate authorities
            where warranted.

            <strong>Aggregated and de-identified data</strong> &mdash; We may aggregate
            and/or de-identify information collected through the services. We may
            use de-identified or aggregated data for any purpose, including marketing
            or analytics.

            <strong>When required under applicable law</strong> &mdash;
            {Var.app.name} is an Indian company with its main data infrastructure
            located in Europe.
          </p>
          <ul class="left-margin bullet-list">
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Requests for user data</strong> &mdash; Our policy is to
                not respond to government requests for user data unless we are compelled
                by legal process or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency
                request. However, if Indian law enforcement authorities have the
                necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring us
                to disclose data, we must comply. Likewise, we will only respond
                to requests from government authorities outside India if compelled
                by the Indian government through procedures outlined in a mutual
                legal assistance treaty or agreement. It is {Var.app.name} policy
                to notify affected users before we disclose data unless we are legally
                prohibited from doing so, and except in some emergency cases.

            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Preservation requests</strong> &mdash; Similarly, {
                  Var.app.name
                }'s policy is to comply with requests to preserve data only if
                compelled by the Indian government, or by a properly served
                Indian subpoena for civil matters. We do not disclose preserved
                data unless required by law or compelled by a court order that
                we choose not to appeal. Furthermore, unless we receive a proper
                warrant, court order, or subpoena before the required
                preservation period expires, we will destroy any preserved
                copies of customer data at the end of the preservation period.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to
                disclose billing-related information. If that happens, we will
                disclose only the minimum needed, such as billing addresses and
                tax exemption information.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          Finally, if {Var.app.name} is acquired by or merges with another company
          — we don’t plan on that, but if it happens — we’ll notify you well before
          any of your personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a
          different privacy policy.

      <h2>Your information rights</h2>
      <p>
        At {Var.app.name}, we strive to apply the same data rights to all users,
        regardless of their location. Some of these rights include:
      </p>
      <ul class="left-margin bullet-list">
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Right to Know</strong> &mdash; You have the right to know what
            personal information is collected, used, shared or sold.
          </p>
          <p>
            We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect,
            as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Right of Access</strong> &mdash; This includes your right to
            access the personal information we gather about you.
          </p>
          <p>
            This also includes your right to obtain information about the
            sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Right to Correction</strong> &mdash; You have the right to request
            correction of your personal information.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Right to Erasure / “To Be Forgotten”</strong> &mdash; This is
            your right to erase your information from our possession.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from
            using
            {Var.app.name}.
          </p>
          <p>
            In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your
            account.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Right to Complain</strong> &mdash; You have the right to make
            a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with
            the appropriate supervisory authority.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Right to Restrict Processing</strong> &mdash; This is your right
            to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used
            or processed, including opting out of sale of your personal information.
            (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Right to Object</strong> &mdash; You have the right, in certain
            situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Right to Portability</strong> &mdash; You have the right to receive
            the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit
            it to another party.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making</strong
            > &mdash; You have the right to object to and prevent any decision that
            could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from being
            made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited if the
            decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and
            us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Right to Non-Discrimination</strong> &mdash; We do not and will
            not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different
            discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you
            have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain
            rights may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from
            using our Services.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and updating your
        account information. Please note that certain information may be exempt
        from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need to retain
        certain information in order to provide our services to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, we also need to take reasonable steps to verify your
        identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a
        minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are
        requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name
        and email address. If we are unable to verify you, we may be unable to
        respond to your requests. If you have questions about exercising these
        rights or need assistance, please contact us at <Link

          target="_blank">{Var.app.contact.email}</Link

        written consent with a signature from the account holder before
        proceeding.
